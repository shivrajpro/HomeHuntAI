## 📖 Overview

Property portals hand you filter dropdowns and a spreadsheet. HomeHunt AI is built on the
opposite premise: **a home is a decision, not a query.**

You tell Nestor something like *"We're expecting our first baby and I work remotely —
need a peaceful 3 BHK to buy in Bangalore under ₹1.8 Cr"*, and it extracts a structured
search intent, ranks homes by weighted **fit** against locality-level AI scores, and explains
every pick — why it fits you, what you're trading off, what the confidence is grounded in,
and which strong homes *just* missed and why.

The app covers four Indian markets — **Bangalore**, **Hyderabad**, **Delhi NCR** and **Pune** —
across 2,000 listings.

> [!NOTE]
> All listings are **fictional**. Builders, projects, addresses, prices and contacts are
> invented. Only localities and nearby landmarks (metros, tech parks, malls, hospitals,
> schools) are real places, with pricing and scores tuned to realistic market bands.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Ask Nestor (`/nestor`)

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Natural-language briefs** | Free-text intent → listing type, city, ₹ budget (`cr` / `lakh` / `k`), BHK, property type, priorities |
| **Voice-first** | **Speak** your brief (browser SpeechRecognition streams words into the composer, then auto-submits) and **hear** Nestor read the top recommendation back (SpeechSynthesis) — a spoken summary of the #1 pick's price, locality, fit and headline strength. A persisted voice-reply toggle auto-reads new answers; every answer also has a "Listen" button. Pure Web APIs, zero backend — and it degrades silently to the typed flow where the APIs are absent (e.g. Firefox has no SpeechRecognition) |
| **Nestor's thinking** | A live, collapsible trace of the real pipeline — scope check → brief understood → catalogue scan → filter → shortlist → Gemini reasoning → validated picks — streamed with the actual counts as each stage runs, then kept as a replayable disclosure on the answer |
| **Multi-turn memory** | Follow-ups refine the previous search instead of resetting — *"make it cheaper"* (×0.8), *"any city"*, *"I don't want apartments"* |
| **Lifestyle-based search** | Life-stage phrases become priorities automatically — *"expecting a baby"*, *"my parents will stay with us"*, *"I work remotely"*, *"we have a dog"* |
| **Why this home** | Plain-language strengths drawn from *your* priorities first — raw scores stay internal |
| **Confidence basis** | Every fit % is grounded in a sentence: top-priority match, budget headroom, and caveats |
| **Near-miss explanations** | *"Why weren't these recommended?"* — strong homes that missed by **exactly one** flexible constraint, with the reason |
| **Visual fit meter** | Per-pick breakdown of Affordability, Commute, Lifestyle, Family and Investment (Investment shown for buy listings only, since appreciation/resale is a buyer concern) — each a qualitative tier (Excellent → Limited) with a plain-language caption (e.g. "₹54 L under your ₹90 L budget"), and the factors you asked for flagged and surfaced first |
| **Trade-off simulator** | "What if" sliders — drag your max budget (+₹20 L) or how much each factor (affordability, commute, family…) counts, and the shortlist re-scores and re-ranks **live**, arrows showing each home's movement. Deterministic, so it runs instantly and fully offline — no Gemini call |
| **Editable priorities** | Remove/add priority chips to re-rank in place — no re-parsing. The toggled chip updates instantly and that turn shows a "Re-ranking picks…" spinner (with dimmed picks) while the re-rank is in flight |
| **Compare picks** | Add any of Nestor's picks to the site-wide compare selection straight from the answer — the same floating tray and side-by-side `/compare` view used from Explore, no need to re-find the homes |
| **Scope guard** | Off-topic first messages get a redirect instead of ranking the whole catalogue |

### 🏘️ Search & Decide

- **Explore** (`/explore`) — responsive card grid with server-side filters (search, Buy/Rent, city, type, exact-match multiselect BHK, max price), URL-synced so any search is shareable and survives refresh, loading skeletons, empty/error states. Loads a small first page (36 rows) for low latency and grows it via "Load more" (+24). The result count shows only once a filter is applied.
- **Property detail** (`/property/:id`) — image gallery, key specs, description + highlights, amenities, nearby landmarks, and a sticky sidebar with price, agent contact (`tel:`/`mailto:`) and neighborhood intel score bars.
- **Compare** (`/compare`) — 2–3 homes side by side, scored across Budget, Commute, Investment Potential, Family Friendliness, Lifestyle Fit and Amenities, with a **"Best overall"** winner, reasoning paragraph and runner-up notes. Homes can be added from Explore, a listing page **or Nestor's picks** — a floating tray follows you across the app (and steps aside once you're on the compare page itself). A comparison is always within a single listing type: picking a **Rent** home while comparing **Buy** homes starts a fresh comparison rather than mixing a purchase against a rental.
- **Shortlist** (`/shortlist`) — heart any home; persisted to `localStorage` with a live count badge in the nav.
- **Decision Report** (`/decision-report`) — a structured write-up of any Nestor answer: User Requirements, AI Understanding, Top Recommendation, Strengths, Trade-offs, Alternative Options, Final Recommendation.
- **Nestor → Explore hand-off** — every answer maps its intent onto Explore's filters via URL query params.

### 🎨 Experience

- Voice-first Nestor — talk your brief in and hear the top pick read back, using the browser's own Web Speech APIs (no backend, no extra dependency)
- Light/dark theming with no flash-of-wrong-theme (light by default)
- Mobile bottom tab bar + floating compare tray
- Route-level code splitting (initial JS ~766 KB, down from ~6 MB), with a one-time reload on stale-chunk fetch failures and a branded route error boundary as backstop
- Framer Motion transitions, accessible labels, verified by an automated axe-core scan

```

**The core design decision:** Gemini reasons, deterministic code constrains. Hard filters,
candidate shortlisting and near-miss selection are **deterministic TypeScript** — Gemini
never sees the whole catalogue, only the ~12 strongest real candidates with their full
data (locality scores, highlights, amenities, nearby landmarks). Within that slate, Gemini
does the deciding end-to-end: which homes to pick, in what order, each pick's 0–100 fit,
its strengths, its honest trade-off, its confidence rationale and the reply summary — all
grounded in listing data it was actually shown. Every id it returns is validated against
the submitted candidate set, so a recommendation can never be hallucinated into existence.

Four layers of graceful degradation:

1. **Local scope gate** — off-topic first messages never reach the network.
2. **Local regex parser** — if `nestor-intent` or Gemini fails (outage, rate limit, network error), `deriveIntentAsync` silently falls back to `parseIntent`/`refineIntent`.
3. **Deterministic ranking fallback** — if `nestor-reason` fails or returns unusable picks, the original weighted-fit ranking with template-based explanations runs instead. A Gemini outage degrades quality, never breaks Nestor.
4. **Rate limiting** — 60 Gemini calls/hour per caller IP across both functions (a turn costs two: parse + reason), logged in `nestor_requests`; the check itself fails open.

## 🧠 AI Capabilities

### Intent extraction — `supabase/functions/nestor-intent`

A Deno edge function calling **Gemini Flash** (`gemini-flash-lite-latest`) with a constrained
`responseSchema`, `temperature: 0` and `maxOutputTokens: 512`, so output always matches the
`NestorIntent` shape the frontend expects.

It extracts: `listingType`, `region`, `maxPrice`, `minBhk`, `propertyType`,
`excludedPropertyTypes`, `priorities` (ordered, most important first), `lifestyleTags`,
`changed` (did this follow-up change anything?) and `offTopic`.

Notable inferences the prompt encodes:

- **Buy vs. Rent from the price unit** — lakh/crore implies a sale price → **Buy**; bare thousands (`45k`) implies monthly rent → **Rent**. An explicit "buy"/"rent" word always wins.
- **City aliases** — Bengaluru/BLR, Hyd/Cyberabad, Gurugram/Noida/Ghaziabad → Delhi NCR, PCMC → Pune.
- **Life-stage → priorities** — nine mapped patterns (retiring, newly married, single professional, growing family, investor, expecting, multigenerational, remote/WFH, pet owner).
- **Follow-up merge semantics** — explicit values override; relative nudges scale the budget; negations add exclusions; newly named priorities move to the front; everything unmentioned carries over.

### Gemini reasoning — `supabase/functions/nestor-reason`

The deciding layer. The frontend sends the brief, the structured intent and the ~12
strongest candidates — full real data per home: price, price-per-sqft, BHK, area, age,
furnishing, RERA status, the seven locality scores, top highlights/amenities and nearby
landmarks with distances. Gemini (same model, constrained `responseSchema`,
`temperature: 0.35`) returns the reply summary plus up to 3 picks, each with its 0–100
fit judgment, 2–4 grounded strengths, one honest trade-off and a confidence rationale.

Anti-hallucination contract, enforced server-side in `sanitize()`:

- Every returned pick id must be one of the submitted candidate ids — unknown or duplicate ids are dropped, and zero usable picks becomes a 502 so the client falls back.
- Fit is clamped to 0–100; strengths are capped at 4; empty text fields invalidate the pick.
- The prompt forbids inventing facts and quoting raw locality scores; prices must be written in Indian units (₹1.2 Cr, ₹85 L, ₹45k/month).

### Deterministic shortlisting & fallback — `src/features/nestor/reasoning/`

Candidate selection stays deterministic: hard filters (city, budget, BHK, type,
exclusions) narrow the catalogue, then a **weighted fit score** over seven locality
dimensions (`walkability`, `familyScore`, `investmentScore`, `commuteScore`,
`safetyScore`, `nightlifeScore`, `greenScore`) shortlists what Gemini sees. The
first-named priority gets the highest weight (`weight = n - i`); ties break on cheaper
price-per-sqft.

If too few homes match, **progressive filter relaxation** loosens the cheapest constraint
first — property type → BHK → budget (+25%) → city — until at least 3 homes surface, and the
reply says which filters were widened.

Near-misses ("why wasn't this recommended?") are also deterministic — they're constraint
arithmetic with exact rupee amounts, not judgment. And when `nestor-reason` is
unavailable, this same weighted ranking plus template-based strengths/trade-off/confidence
text produces the answer, so the product works end-to-end with Gemini fully down.

Because shortlisting is deterministic, the **trade-off simulator**
(`src/features/nestor/trade-off.ts`) reuses it as a live sandbox: the answer keeps its
hydrated shortlist, and the UI re-scores that pool client-side as the user drags their max
budget (an amount) or how much each factor counts (importance weights) — blending the same
seven locality scores with the fit meter's budget-fit curve — so the ranking re-orders
instantly with no network or Gemini call, and a slider change can promote a candidate above
the current top picks.

## 🚀 Installation & Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.6+** (the migration script uses `node --env-file`)
- A **Supabase** project — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (free tier is fine)
- A **Google Gemini API key** — [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivrajpro/HomeHuntAI.git
cd HomeHuntAI
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the values from your Supabase dashboard (**Settings → API**):

| Variable | Where it's used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Browser (`src/lib/supabase.ts`) | Your project URL. Safe to expose. |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Browser | The `anon` public key. Safe to expose — RLS restricts it to reads. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | `scripts/migrate-to-supabase.mjs` only | ⚠️ **Bypasses RLS.** Never prefix with `VITE_`, never expose to the frontend, never commit. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Edge function secret (see below) | Set via the Supabase CLI, **not** in `.env`. |

> `.env` is git-ignored. `.env.example` holds blank placeholders only.

The app throws on startup if `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are missing.

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup & Seeding

### 1. Create the tables

Run all three migrations in the Supabase dashboard's **SQL Editor** (in order):

1. `supabase/migrations/0001_create_properties.sql` — the `properties` table, filter indexes, RLS with a public read-only policy.
2. `supabase/migrations/0002_create_copilot_requests.sql` — the rate-limit log (RLS enabled, no policies — only the edge function's service-role key touches it).
3. `supabase/migrations/0003_rename_copilot_requests_to_nestor.sql` — renames that table to `nestor_requests`, following the rename of the assistant to Nestor. 0002 still creates the table under its old name because it was already applied to the live database; the rename is a forward migration rather than an edit to history.

### 2. Load the seed

```bash
npm run migrate:supabase
```

This pushes all 2,000 listings from `src/features/properties/data/listings.json` into Postgres
using the service-role key. Verify with `content-range: 0-0/2000` from the REST API.

### About the seed data

**2,000 fictional listings — 500 per market**, shaped like a real portal:

| Market | Sample localities |
| --- | --- |
| **Bangalore, Karnataka** | Electronic City, Whitefield, Sarjapur Road, HSR Layout, Koramangala, Indiranagar |
| **Hyderabad, Telangana** | Gachibowli, Kondapur, Madhapur, Financial District, Kokapet, Banjara/Jubilee Hills |
| **Delhi NCR** | Noida (Sec 150/137/76), Greater Noida West, Dwarka, Gurugram (Golf Course Rd, Sohna Rd), Ghaziabad, Faridabad |
| **Pune, Maharashtra** | Hinjewadi, Wakad, Baner, Balewadi, Kharadi, Hadapsar, Viman Nagar, Koregaon Park, Aundh |

Distribution: **1,492 Buy / 508 Rent** · **1,336 Apartments**, 216 Independent Houses,
181 Villas, 177 Builder Floors, 90 Plots. Every listing carries seven locality AI scores plus
pricing, areas, RERA status and amenities tuned to real market bands. The shape is defined and
validated by the Zod schema in `src/features/properties/types.ts`.

### Regenerating the seed

The generator uses a seeded PRNG, so re-running produces an identical file:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Edit locality bands, landmarks or distributions in [`scripts/generate-listings.mjs`](scripts/generate-listings.mjs).

### Deploying the edge functions

Nestor's Gemini layers need both functions deployed — `nestor-intent` (brief → structured
intent) and `nestor-reason` (candidates → picks + explanations):

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
npx supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-key>
npx supabase functions deploy nestor-intent
npx supabase functions deploy nestor-reason
```

This function was previously named `copilot-intent`. Renaming it in the repo does **not** rename
the deployed function, so an existing project needs the new one deployed and the old one removed:

```bash
npx supabase functions delete copilot-intent
```

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are auto-populated by the Edge Function
runtime — no manual config needed. Dependencies resolve at deploy time via `npm:` specifiers,
so there's no separate install step.

> Without these, Nestor still works — it falls back to the local regex parser and the
> deterministic ranking.

### Tests

```bash
npm test                         # Fast everyday run — 70 tests, Chromium only
npm run test:all                 # Full pre-release sweep — 420 runs across 6 browser/device projects
npm run test:ui                  # Interactive mode
npx playwright show-report       # Last HTML report
```

Coverage spans every route, filters and search, Nestor (including Gemini-outage and
rate-limit fallback), the voice-first controls, compare, shortlist, theming, 404s, per-page SEO
titles, and an automated **axe-core accessibility scan**. The default run uses Chromium only for speed; `test:all`
(or `ALL_BROWSERS=1`, set automatically on CI) expands to the full matrix — Chromium, Firefox,
WebKit, iPad Mini, Pixel 5, iPhone 12. The config auto-starts the dev server.

## ☁️ Deployment

**Live at [home-hunt-ai.vercel.app](https://home-hunt-ai.vercel.app/)**

| Piece | Host |
| --- | --- |
| React SPA | Vercel |
| Postgres + Edge Functions | Supabase |
| Gemini API | Google AI |

Vercel setup:

1. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) — Vite is auto-detected (`npm run build` → `dist`).
2. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` under **Settings → Environment Variables**.
3. Deploy.

[`vercel.json`](vercel.json) rewrites all paths to `/index.html` so client-side routes deep-link
correctly on refresh.

> Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars belong in Vercel. The service-role key stays local; the Gemini key
> lives in Supabase secrets.

## 🔌 API & AI Integrations

| Integration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Supabase PostgREST** (`@supabase/supabase-js`) | All listing reads. Filters (`region`, `listing_type`, `property_type`, `bhk`, `price`) run server-side as query predicates; free-text search uses `.or()` + `ilike` across title, locality, sub-locality, city and project name. Rows are mapped snake_case → camelCase and validated through `propertySchema.parse` so bad data fails loudly. |
| **Supabase Edge Functions** | Hosts `nestor-intent` (`POST { rawText, prevIntent }` → `{ intent, refined, offTopic }`, input capped at 500 chars) and `nestor-reason` (`POST { brief, intent, candidates, context }` → `{ summary, picks }`, ids validated against the submitted candidates). Both Deno, CORS-enabled, sharing one rate-limit log. |
| **Google Gemini** (`@google/genai`) | Two calls per turn: intent extraction, then reasoning over the candidate shortlist — both with constrained JSON `responseSchema`s. Server-side only — the API key never reaches the browser. |

**Data flow for one Nestor turn:**

```
brief → isLikelyOutOfScope? ──yes──► redirect reply (no network)
             │no
             ▼
   nestor-intent (rate limit → Gemini → JSON)
             │
        ok ──┴── fail ──► local regex parser (parseIntent / refineIntent)
             ▼
   NestorIntent → selectCandidates → fitScore shortlist (top 12) → hydrate
             ▼
   nestor-reason (rate limit → Gemini picks/ranks/explains → id validation)
             │
        ok ──┴── fail ──► deterministic ranking + template explanations
             ▼
   picks + near-misses (deterministic) → NestorAnswer
```

Each stage above also reports itself through an optional `NestorTrace` callback
(`runNestor(..., onTrace)`) the moment it starts and finishes, carrying the real
count it worked with. That's what powers the **"Nestor's thinking"** panel — the
trace is purely observational and never alters what the pipeline produces.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

Not yet implemented:

- **Supabase Storage** — real uploaded property imagery.
- **Smaller polish** — a shortlist heart on Nestor's pick cards; bulk-clearing the shortlist; a drawer if mobile nav outgrows 4 tabs.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork and branch off `master` (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
2. Follow the existing structure — features live in `src/features/<domain>/`, shared UI in `src/components/ui/`.
3. `src/features/properties/types.ts` is the **single source of truth**. Change the Zod schema first; types are inferred from it.
4. Keep Nestor's **hard filters, shortlisting and near-misses deterministic**. Gemini decides and explains only within the validated candidate slate — never let it see the whole catalogue or emit an unvalidated id.
5. Before opening a PR:

   ```bash
   npm run lint          # Oxlint
   npm run build         # tsc -b && vite build
   npm run test:all      # E2E + accessibility, full browser matrix
   ```

6. Update this README if your change affects documented behavior.

> A few standing lint warnings (`react/only-export-components`, for files that export
> shared constants or hooks alongside components) are accepted in `src/components/ui/button.tsx`,
> the compare/shortlist contexts and `src/features/properties/components/listbox.tsx`.

**Never commit** `.env`, the service-role key, or the Gemini key.
